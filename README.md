# Numeric

**Numeric** is a numerical analysis library written on python, it aims to ease numerical computations (specially when the result must be written a human-readable format in latex).

## Origin And Scope

At first it was a tool to generate homeworks of my numerical methods course at university, and generate a human-readable latex report just by describing algorithms and computation.

Then I believe it can be useful in generation of reports of experiments and numerical operations dealing with errors correctly and generate step-by-step reports though it stores the computation graph.

## How to use

You can see a bunch of examples in 'examples/' folder. It must be compatible with python around versions 3.6!
